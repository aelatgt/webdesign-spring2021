  This page will include stuff from Reality Media Chapter 10 - Future
</p>

<p>The myths of total AR and VR make an assumption similar to the received narrative for film: that AR and VR will each develop according to their own inner logic until they achieve perfection. In the case of AR, there will be a single mirror world that perfectly and completely reflects our lived world. In the case of VR, there will be a single metaverse, a benign version of the Matrix. We have argued throughout this book that the future of both these media will instead resemble the actual history of film since the early twentieth century. AR and VR technologies will certainly improve significantly and may eventually reach a stage of relative stability after which there are only refinements. But their genres will follow trajectories that will converge and diverge with other genres in our larger media culture. As reality media, AR and VR can continue to develop and to participate in remediating relationships with other media indefinitely.</p>

<h2 id="the-possible-the-plausible-and-the-probable">The Possible, the Plausible, and the Probable</h2>

<p>To acknowledge a range of media futures, we appeal to a classification strategy suggested by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby (2013) in Speculative Everything, borrowed in turn from designer Stewart Candy. They offer a set of terms that can help to distinguish between the technological fantasies and predictions that take into account the conservatism of human users and institutions. Dunne and Raby speak of the possible, the plausible, and the probable—a classification schema they can apply to speculations about all sorts of technological, economic, and social futures. Because we are speculating here about VR and AR, the possible comprises every conceivable advance in VR and AR hardware and software: whatever has the remotest chance of occurring, the most utopian (or dystopian) predictions of how the technology will develop and be used. For example, a future in which a large number of people in the developed world choose to spend much of their time in a VR metaverse. The plausible includes future developments that seem more likely to happen: for example, the merging of AR into the general interface for mobile phones. A probable future is the adoption of VR as a dominant platform for 3-D computer games. The lines between the probable and plausible and between the plausible and possible are obviously blurry, and they become blurrier as we move further into the future. Such speculation has always been the realm of sci-fi novels and films, and it is hard to avoid sounding like science fiction when we try to imagine VR or AR in the coming decades. Novels like Snow Crash and films like Ready Player Oneare indeed sources for envisioning the possible (or something just beyond the possible) and, less frequently, the plausible and the probable.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-vr-technology">The Future of VR Technology</h2>

<p>Although still often portrayed as the “ultimate display,” VR will not usurp all the functions of other displays, from huge high-rec monitors to phones and smartwatches. Soon, however, its place among accepted media platforms will no longer require justification. VR headsets will no longer seem like toys for geeks, any more than smartwatches do now. VR will, however, continue to construct special realities, apart from the everyday. This will remain a technological necessity as long as VR headsets close us off from the physical world. VR will continue to construct special realities, apart from the everyday. VR worlds will continue to be metaphoric worlds.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-ar-technology">The Future of AR Technology</h2>

<p>AR headsets such as HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap are still for special moments and work activities. Users put them on to play a game or repair a car engine and then take them off again to go about their day. The question is when and whether, as with conventional glasses, people will put on some future version in the morning and take them off at night. Is it plausible or probable that AR glasses will become ubiquitous? Improvements in style and comfort are inevitable, but to be worn constantly, they will have to be as comfortable and conventional as today’s glasses. It is already possible to order prescription lenses for the Magic Leap (Locklear 2018), but the 2020 version of Magic Leap reminds us of the headgear that Cyclops wears to keep his power-beaming eyes from incinerating bystanders (figure 10.1).</p>
