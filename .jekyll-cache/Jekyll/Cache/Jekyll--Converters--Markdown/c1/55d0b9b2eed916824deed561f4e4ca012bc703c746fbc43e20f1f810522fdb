<p><em>In January 1896 an audience in a basement room of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films shown was The Arrival of the Train at la Ciotat Station. All that happens in the approximately 50-second film is that a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. As the train comes closer, some in the audience panic. Imagining that the train is going to burst out of the screen into the room, they leave their seats and rush for the door.</em></p>

<p>It is a great story but almost certainly apocryphal. The sophisticated Parisian audience were astonished, not fooled, and what astonished them was that moving images could seem so real (Gunning [1989] 2009; 1986). They were astonished not by reality, but by a reality medium. Film became one of the most important reality media of the twentieth century, and in some ways, it is a forerunner of Virtual Reality. Let’s reimagine that scene in VR.</p>

<p><em>Seated in your living room at home, you put on your VR headset and are transported back to that hall in the Grand Café. You can look all around you at the other spectators. You can turn all the way around and see the back of the hall. All of these are rendered in realistic 3D graphics. The Arrival of the Train at La Ciotat Station begins to play on the screen. When the train approaches, the shiny engine bursts through the screen into the hall and comes to a stop among scattered chairs. The 3D spectators jump up and have managed to get out of the way.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-are-reality-media">What are reality media?</h2>
<p>Reality media redefine reality also in two ways. Reality media do not get us closer to some absolute definition of the real world; instead, they work by comparison. When the screening of La Ciotat announced film as a new reality medium in 1896, the audience was comparing what they saw on the screen to other media that they knew, particularly photography. The film was photography in motion, and so it looked more like a moving train than any medium they had seen before. From that moment on, their reality was redefined because a new reality medium now existed that gave them a new perspective on the real. We call this the La Ciotat effect, and it is the effect that each reality medium has. Each offers us a new representation of the world that we implicitly compare to our experience of the world in itself and through other media.</p>
