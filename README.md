##  Theme and How to Use
This is a theme called **Hyde** for a Jekyll website. Because the original code of the theme was incompatiable with the current version of Jekyll (v4.2.0), I made changes to the original code to make it able to run under the current version of Jekyll.

Current website contains Landing page, Chapter 0 - Introduction, and Chapter 10 - The Future of the book *Reality Media*.

After cloning the this repository or downloading this code, you should be able to serve this website on your local server using the command in the folder that this repository exists.

```
jekyll serve
```

Make sure all the prerquisites for running Jekyll are satisfied.

**The original codes and documentation of the theme are available at:**

## **Current Issues** 
* This code is not able to be fully deployed using GitHub pages. Additional fixes are necessary to serve the website using GitHub pages.
    * Mainly, the links on the navigation bar do not correctly link to corresponding pages.
    * Generally, when making changes on the website, edit codes in **_config.yml**
