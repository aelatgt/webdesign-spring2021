# Jekyll Website Template - Hyde

### Updated on April 17th, 2021

This is a theme called **Hyde** for a Jekyll website. Because the original code of the theme was incompatiable with the current version of Jekyll(v4.2.0), I fixed the code little bit to make it able to run under the current version of Jekyll.

After cloning the this repository, you should be able to serve this template on your local server using the command in the folder that this repository exists.

```
jekyll serve
```

Make sure all the prerquisites for running Jekyll are installed.
